- React JS for frontend
- CSS for styling
- TypeScript and JavaScript as scripting language

### Smart Contracts Used In Project

#### Change Method

`create_article`

#### View Method

`get_articles`

```bash
  export function create_article(articleName:string, articleHeading:string, author:string, content:string, articleImage:string): void {
   // Create article logic
  }

  export function get_articles(user:string):string[] {
   // View articles logic
  }

```

### Steps for local Setup

1. Prerequisites: Make sure you've installed [Node.js] â‰¥ 12 and `yarn latest version`
2. Clone the repository - `https://github.com/lhtPrathamesh/Decentralized-Thoughts.git`
3. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
4. Run the local development server: `yarn dev` (see `package.json` for a
   full list of `scripts` you can run with `yarn`)

Now you'll have a local development environment backed by the NEAR TestNet!

### Exploring The Code

1. The "backend" code lives in the `/contract` folder. See the README there for
   more info.
2. The frontend code lives in the `/frontend` folder. `/frontend/index.html` is a great
   place to start exploring. Note that it loads in `/frontend/assets/js/index.js`, where you
   can learn how the frontend connects to the NEAR blockchain.
3. Tests: there are different kinds of tests for the frontend and the smart
   contract. See `contract/README` for info about how it's tested. The frontend
   code gets tested with [jest]. You can run both of these at once with `yarn run test`.
